# Casino-Star
Casino Star created by Patryk 'UltiPro' WÃ³jtowicz using ASP.NET Core App with Angular.

The casino website that includes roulette and coin-flip. Each game has several gameplay options and has its own animations for the best experience. Additionally, the website has a settings panel with the option of paying extra funds. Due to studies and a lack of time, the project was abandoned.

Warning:

> This application is my second major project in college, so there is a lot of ugly code. Additionally, instead of using EF Core and Identity, stored procedures and JWT Token Authentication/Authorization were used. The template of the project comes from .NET 6.
